# DD2434-Advanced-Machine-Learning
Repository for the code written in assignments.


## Assignment 1
The assignment was implemented using Matlab. In the folder named Assignment 1, one can find the seperate .m files for each implementation (PCA, MDS and Isomap) as well as the datafile zoo.data. All matlab scripts are dependent on the prep_data.m function. Therefore if the entire folder is downloaded one should simply be able to run each script in order to recreate plots and results shown in my report.
